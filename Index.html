    <h2 id="hed2"><u>Introduction</u></h2>
    <b>New Year is the time or day at which a new calendar year begins and the calendar's year count increments
    by one. Many cultures celebrate the event in some manner. In the Gregorian calendar, the most widely used 
    calendar system today, New Year occurs on January 1 (New Year's Day). This was also the first day of the 
    year in the original Julian calendar and the Roman calendar (after 153 BC).<br><br>

    Other cultures observe their traditional or religious New Year's Day according to their own customs,
    typically (though not invariably) because they use a lunar calendar or a lunisolar calendar.
    Chinese New Year, the Islamic New Year, and the Jewish New Year are among well-known examples. 
    India, Nepal and other countries also celebrate New Year on dates according to their own calendars that
    are movable in the Gregorian calendar.</b>

    <h2 id="hed3"><u>January 1 Becomes New Year's Day</u></h2>
    <b>The early Roman calendar consisted of 10 months and 304 days, with each new year beginning at the
    vernal equinox; according to tradition, it was created by Romulus, the founder of Rome,
    in the eighth century B.C. A later king, Numa Pompilius, is credited with adding the months of Januarius
    and Februarius. Over the centuries, the calendar fell out of sync with the sun, and in 46 B.C. the emperor
    Julius Caesar decided to solve the problem by consulting with the most prominent astronomers and
    mathematicians of his time. He introduced the Julian calendar, which closely resembles the more modern
    Gregorian calendar that most countries around the world use today.<br><br>
    
    As part of his reform, Caesar instituted January 1 as the first day of the year, partly to honor the
    month's namesake: Janus, the Roman god of beginnings, whose two faces allowed him to look back into the
    past and forward into the future. Romans celebrated by offering sacrifices to Janus, exchanging gifts with
    one another, decorating their homes with laurel branches and attending raucous parties. In medieval Europe,
    Christian leaders temporarily replaced January 1 as the first of the year with days carrying more
    religious significance, such as December 25 (the anniversary of Jesus' birth) and March 25 
    (the Feast of the Annunciation); Pope Gregory XIII reestablished January 1 as New Year's Day in 1582.</b>

    <h2 id="hed4"><u>Ancient New Year's Celebrations</u></h2>
    <b>The earliest recorded festivities in honor of a new year's arrival date back some 4,000 years to
        ancient Babylon. For the Babylonians, the first new moon following the vernal equinox—the day in late
        March with an equal amount of sunlight and darkness—heralded the start of a new year. 
        They marked the occasion with a massive religious festival called Akitu (derived from the Sumerian
        word for barley, which was cut in the spring) that involved a different ritual on each of its 11 days.
        In addition to the new year, Atiku celebrated the mythical victory of the Babylonian sky god Marduk over
        the evil sea goddess Tiamat and served an important political purpose: It was during this time that a
        new king was crowned or that the current ruler's divine mandate was symbolically renewed.</b>
