<h2 id="hed2"><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<b>Christmas does not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and
Tertullian. Origen and Arnobius fault the pagans for celebrating birthdays, which suggests that Christmas
was not celebrated in their time. Arnobius wrote after AD 297. The Chronograph of 354 records that a Christmas
celebration took place in Rome eight days before the calends of January. This section was written in AD 336,
during the brief pontificate of Pope Mark.<br><br>

In the East, the birth of Jesus was celebrated in connection with the Epiphany on January 6. This holiday]
was not primarily about the nativity, but rather the baptism of Jesus. Christmas was promoted in the East
as part of the revival of Orthodox Christianity that followed the death of the pro-Arian Emperor Valens at the
Battle of Adrianople in 378. The feast was introduced in Constantinople in 379, in Antioch by John Chrysostom
towards the end of the fourth century, probably in 388, and in Alexandria in the following century.</b>

<h2 id="hed3"><u>Mordern History</u></h2>
<b>Associating it with drunkenness and other misbehaviour, the Puritans banned Christmas in England in the 17th
century. It was restored as a legal holiday in 1660, but remained disreputable. In the early 19th century,
the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church ushered in "the development of richer and more symbolic forms of
worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of
Christmas itself as a Christian festival" as well as "special charities for the poor" in addition to 
"special services and musical events".[43] Charles Dickens and other writers helped in this revival of the 
holiday by "changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated" as they emphasized 
family, religion, gift-giving, and social reconciliation as opposed to the historic revelry common in some 
places.</b>

<h2 id="hed4"><u>Decorations</u></h2>
<b>The Christmas tree was first used by German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a 
Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strassburg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant 
Reformer, Martin Bucer. In the United States, these "German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree
with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees."[170][171] When decorating the Christmas tree,
many individuals place a star at the top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem, a fact recorded by 
The School Journal in 1897. Professor David Albert Jones of Oxford University writes that in the 19th century,
it became popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of Jesus.<br><br>

The Christmas tree is considered by some as Christianisation of pagan tradition and ritual surrounding 
the Winter Solstice, which included the use of evergreen boughs, and an adaptation of pagan tree worship;
according to eighth-century biographer Ã†ddi Stephanus, Saint Boniface (634-709), who was a missionary in 
Germany, took an ax to an oak tree dedicated to Thor and pointed out a fir tree, which he stated was a more
fitting object of reverence because it pointed to heaven and it had a triangular shape, which he said was 
symbolic of the Trinity.[176] The English language phrase "Christmas tree" is first recorded in 1835 and
represents an importation from the German language.</b>
